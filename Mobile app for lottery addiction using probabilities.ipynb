    "# A Mobile App for Lottery Addiction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will play the role of data scientist consultant for a medical institute that aims to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. The institute has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need us to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people start playing the lottery for fun, but for some this activity turns into a habit which eventually escalates into addiction. Like other compulsive gamblers, lottery addicts soon begin spending from their savings and loans, they start to accumulate debts, and eventually engage in desperate behaviors like theft.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first version of the app, they want us to focus on the [6/49 lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49) and build functions that enable users to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the probability of winning the big prize with a sigle ticket?\n",
    "* What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "* What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "The institute also wants us to consider historical data coming from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. [The data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) has data for 3,665 drawings, dating from 1982 to 2018."

    "We created five functions for the first version of a gambling addiction app:\n",
    "* `one_ticket_probability()` — calculates the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket.\n",
    "* `check_historical_occurrence()` — checks whether a certain combination has occurred in the Canada lottery data set.\n",
    "* `multi_ticket_probability()` — calculates the probability for any number of of tickets between 1 and 13,983,816.\n",
    "* `probability_less_6()` — calculates the probability of having two, three, four or five winning numbers.\n",
    "* `probability_less_6_atleast()` — calculates the probability of having *at least* two, three, four or five winning numbers.\n",

    "## Next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible features for a second version of the app include:\n",
    "* Making the outputs even easier to understand by adding fun analogies (for example, we can find probabilities for strange events and compare with the chances of winning in lottery; for instance, we can output something along the lines \"You are 100 times more likely to be the victim of a shark attack than winning the lottery\").\n",
    "* Combining `one_ticket_probability()` and `check_historical_occurrence()` functions to output information on probability and historical occurrence at the same time.\n",
    "* Begin adding information/probabilities for other lottery formats and gambling games."
